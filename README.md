    <h1>Artificial Neural Networks and Their Types</h1>
    <p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process and transmit information.</p>
    <h2>Types of Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>There are several types of ANNs, but two of the most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</b>: These are the most basic type of neural network and are used for a wide range of applications, including classification, regression, and clustering.</li>
        <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b>: These are a type of neural network specifically designed for image and signal processing tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</h2>
    <p>ANNs are the most basic type of neural network and are used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Classification: ANNs can be used to classify data into different categories or classes.</li>
        <li>Regression: ANNs can be used to predict continuous values or outcomes.</li>
        <li>Clustering: ANNs can be used to group similar data points together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>CNNs are a type of neural network specifically designed for image and signal processing tasks, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image Classification: CNNs can be used to classify images into different categories or classes.</li>
        <li>Object Detection: CNNs can be used to detect objects within images.</li>
        <li>Image Segmentation: CNNs can be used to segment images into different regions or objects.</li>
